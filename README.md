# Memory Game - Mile Stone Project II

This game was made to give me a better undertanding of javaScript, it's a 
normal memory game with card  that has two levels of dificulty. The idea 
is to match two cards with the same picture. I choose programming language
to be tha card face and to the back face i've choose code institute logo.

### Ux

The memory game it's a front-end project where you can find a normal 
card game that match two cards from the same type, its has two levels 
of dificilty. 

As a gamer i want to finish all levels so that i can complete the first level,
and click on the next level picture to go to the nextl level. Same thing will happen
when you finish the other level it appears a Congrats! message and when you click on the picture 
insted to the next level you have a choice to play again from the begining.

 
### Technologies Used

To build this project i have used:

-HTML
-CSS
-JAVASCRIPT
-BOOTSTRAP

### Features

This site is feature with bootstrap4 to give responsive design to different screens sizes.


### Features left to implement

In the future this game will have one more level of dificulty with 64 cards and 32 matches, also it will
be implemented a cronometer and a click counter so when you finish the whole game it will appear to the
user how many clicks they made to complete the game and in how long time.


### Testing

The memory game was created to be fun easy and nice to play. When you load the first page
it will appear 4 x 4 line with 16 cards to flip, so whem you click n the card the card will 
turn and will show one programming language, the idea is to match the same programming language cards,
this first page will have 8 matches and on every card match a little data sign will appear very fast to 
interaction with the user and show them they got one match. Notice that the user can give one click per card
that will flip that card. When the user finish to flip all the cards and match them a modal screen
will appear with a picture to go to the next level.

On the next level it will appear 32 cards with a total of 16 matches. In this level the user
will have the same experience as the first level, but, harder and longer to finish. When all
matches is obtained another modal screen will appear giving user congrats! and a restat sign
to start the game from the first level in case of the user wants to play again.

This site has been tested as responvise design in multiples devices as Desktop, Tablets and Phones.

### Credits

I would like to give some credits to the youtube video that have made me understand how
this memory game works specially with javascript. From that video i have picked up the 
memory game idea and from that i have made some adapitations specially to the javascript 
code where i have implemented another level of dificulty and diferent sizes of boards and card,
as well diferent front and back pictures.

I would like to give some credits to my Mentor Aaron Sinnott that helped me during the whole project.
